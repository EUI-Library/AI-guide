The question of epistemology and transparency in the use of AI in research processes is a decisive factor in the very <u>legitimacy of contemporary science</u>.

The adoption of Generative Systems is not merely an instrumental update, but has a profound impact on the <u>logic of knowledge production</u>, altering the criteria by which knowledge is constructed, validated and shared.

The GAI, in its ability to *select*, *organise* and *synthesise sources*, directly intervenes in the definition of “**scientific truth**”, expanding the possibilities of access to information but at the same time introducing new areas of opacity and fragility in terms of **verifiability**.

The tools developed in the field of **Explainable AI (XAI)** are a significant attempt to restore transparency to otherwise uninterpretable processes, but they fail to bridge the gap between the <u>epistemic needs</u> of the scientific community and the <u>opaque complexity of deep architectures</u>.

## The relationship between researcher and AI is one of <u>co-agency</u>, in which humans retain the role of *guarantor of cognitive and ethical processes*, but must contend with a *technological agent* that introduces new possibilities and, at the same time, new opacity.
:::

This transformation requires the Academic Community to reflect on the <u>soundness of the founding principles of modern science</u>:\
- the verifiability of results\
- the methodological transparency\
- the neutrality of sources\
- the individual and collective responsibility in the evaluation phases.

Introducing AI Systems, particularly their generative applications, tests these assumptions along <u>four main lines</u>:

1.  **the Epistemological Dimension of Transparency**\
2.  **the issue of Bias and Source quality**\
3.  **the redefinition of Accountability in peer review processes**\
4.  **towards a renewed Operational Ethic**.

The use of GAI in research cannot be considered a simple technical support, but must be treated as an **epistemic object in its own right**, capable of influencing the entire <u>knowledge ecosystem</u>.

👉 On the one hand, AI significantly <u>expands the analytical and synthetic capabilities of researchers</u>, offering tools capable of processing huge amounts of data and generating hypotheses.

👉 On the other hand, it <u>introduces concrete risks</u>, such as *algorithmic opacity, the propagation of errors or biases, the weakening of traditional accountability mechanisms* and *the potential erosion of public trust in science*.

Analysing these implications in depth means maintaining a <u>constant tension</u> between *technological innovation* and *scientific integrity* as a guiding principle, so that AI can be integrated without compromising the principles that guarantee the credibility of research.
