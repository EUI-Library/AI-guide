## 1. Sources of bias in training data

One of the most problematic aspects of using AI in research processes is the **bias** inherent in training data.  
The data of training of models are never <u>neutral</u>, but reflect *quantitative* and *qualitative* imbalances that derive from their very composition. 

The prevalence of certain languages, geographical areas or disciplines leads to an <u>over-representation</u> of specific contexts, while other perspectives remain marginal or absent.   

[👉 The result is **partial knowledge**, which risks presenting itself as universal despite being based on incomplete foundations.]{.mark}

Alongside these quantitative imbalances, AI systems incorporate **implicit cultural biases**.   
The data reflect the *values*, *conventions* and *symbolic hierarchies* of the communities that generated them.  
When these perspectives are assumed to be neutral, algorithms end up replicating *gender stereotypes, ethnocentric views* or *ideologically oriented representations*, masking them behind the supposed objectivity of statistical calculation.

A further source of criticism lies in **methodological biases**.   
The collection, selection and normalisation of data respond to criteria that are not always made "explicit", but which directly influence the outcomes of training.  
Choices relating to *sampling methods*, *corpus cleaning* or the definition of *conceptual categories* determine an invisible structure that guides the model's inferences.

👉 In this sense, bias is not an accidental residue, but rather a **structural consequence** of the dataset construction process.
</span>
:::

These different levels of distortion converge to generate a significant **epistemic risk**, i.e. the possibility that scientific research is based on already compromised knowledge, without these limitations being immediately recognisable.  
The apparent authority of AI-generated texts can conceal <u>systematic imbalances</u>, imposing on the Academic Community the need to develop **critical monitoring tools**.

The issue of the **traceability** of algorithmic decisions therefore takes on 
importance.
<u>Audit logs</u>, <u>fairness metrics</u> and <u>data documentation practices</u> are fundamental tools for making the path leading to a given output recognisable and verifiable. 

These mechanisms do not solve the structural problems of datasets, but they introduce elements of **accountability** that allow researchers to evaluate the consistency of results with criteria of transparency and fairness.

<span style='font-size:1.2em; color: #ff0000ff;'>
👉 The distinction between <u>verified knowledge</u> and <u>probabilistic inference</u> becomes an essential condition for preventing automation from compromising the epistemic reliability of research.
</span>
:::

Another critical element concerns the **nature of the content** produced by generative systems, which may include *non-existent bibliographic references*, *invented citations*, or *distorted summaries of articles* that have actually been published.  
These phenomena, often referred to as algorithmic **“hallucinations”**, directly undermine scientific credibility if they are not promptly recognised and corrected. 

::: {.callout-note icon="false" appearance="simple"}
<span style='font-size:1.2em'>
The responsibility therefore falls on the <u>researcher</u>, who is called upon to **rigorously distinguish** between what belongs to the domain of scientific validity and what remains a statistical projection without empirical basis.
</span>
:::

The problem of bias, therefore, cannot be reduced to a technical issue, but also has **ethical** and **political implications**.  
Research risks consolidating inequalities already present in society if shared criteria of inclusivity and fairness are not developed in the selection and management of data.  
The GAI, from a potentially emancipatory resource, can become a <u>device of exclusion</u> if left unchecked. 

[ 👉 For this reason, alongside individual critical vigilance, it is essential to promote **institutional policies** and **editorial guidelines** that guarantee the reliability of sources, the transparency of datasets and respect for the principles of pluralism and neutrality that underpin the scientific community.]{.mark}

## 2. Strategies for the traceability and verifiability of algorithmic decisions

One of the key issues in the use of AI systems in scientific research, is the ability to guarantee the **reconstruction** and **validation** of the <u>decision-making processes</u> that lead to a given output. 

Unlike human work, where the analysis and inference phases can be explicitly justified and discussed, algorithms operate through <u>chains of calculations</u> that are often *opaque* and *difficult to interpret*, even for the developers themselves. 

👉 **To reduce this lack of transparency, it is necessary to introduce tools that allow the model's performance to be systematically documented, monitored and evaluated.**

In this perspective, **audit logs** represent a first fundamental mechanism.   
They consist of udetailed records of the <u>steps taken by the algorithm during data processing</u>, from the input phase to the generation of the output, including any intermediate transformations.  
These records not only allow the path followed by the system to be *traced retrospectively*, but also identify any <u>critical issues</u>, such as the use of partial sources or the application of undeclared selection criteria. 

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" appearance="simple"}
<span style='font-size:1.1em; color: #000000ff;'>
👉 In Academic context, this traceability has significant **epistemic value**, because it allows not only the final results to be subjected to intersubjective control, but also the entire process that produced them.
</span>
:::

Alongside process documentation, there is the issue of **verifying the fairness of results**. Algorithms are not just calculation tools, but devices that incorporate and convey specific hierarchies of relevance.  
**Fairness metrics** have been developed precisely to make these dynamics "measurable", translating dimensions often considered qualitative, such as *inclusion*, *representativeness* or *non-discrimination*, into numerical parameters.   
Through <u>comparative indicators</u>, for example, it is possible to verify whether a model tends to favour certain categories of data or users over others, and whether these imbalances are statistically significant.

[👉 The joint application of <u>audit logs</u> and <u>fairness metrics</u> is not limited to technical monitoring, but opens up the possibility of developing shared responsibility in AI management.]{.mark}

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" appearance="simple"}
<span style='font-size:1.1em; color: #ff0000ff;'>
This means shifting the focus from isolated output to the **production context**, where methodological choices and evaluation criteria must be made <u>explicit</u> and subjected to <u>collective discussion</u>.   
In this sense, the verifiability of algorithmic decisions becomes a <u>structural element of scientific governance</u>, a device aimed not only at ensuring greater transparency, but also at strengthening the <u>epistemic legitimacy</u> of the results obtained.
</span>
:::

Finally, it is important to emphasise that **traceability** and **fairness assessment** cannot be understood as occasional or ancillary practices, but must become an integral part of research procedures.  

[The <u>systematic adoption</u> of these tools is a necessary condition for preserving the reliability of scientific knowledge in the age of automation, preventing the complexity of generative models from translating into a deficit of critical control. ]{.mark}
