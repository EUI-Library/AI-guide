## 1. Practical introduction to GAI Tools

The integration of Generative AI (GAI) tools into research activities requires an informed and conscious selection of the available resources. It is essential for a researcher to distinguish between different types of operational tools and to understand how they work in relation to specific research goals.

We can classify tools into three main categories:

-   **General-purpose Language Models (LLMs)**: mainly used for writing, editing, and language support tasks.
-   **Specialized Documentary Tools**: focused on the collection, synthesis, and analysis of scientific literature.
-   **Integrated Automation Systems**: plugins, APIs, or hybrid platforms that extend basic capabilities, adapting them to customized workflows.

The effective use of these tools requires not only technical knowledge but also the ability to assess their suitability based on:

-   *Transparency and traceability of results*
-   *Data source currency and validity*
-   *Level of customization allowed (advanced prompting, proprietary data training)*
-   *Compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements specific to academic research*

::: {.callout-important icon="false" title="<span style='font-size:1.1em; color: #133869ff;'>Particularly in *SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities)*, these aspects are critical due to risks such as methodological biases, ambiguities in intellectual property management, and sensitive data handling issues.</span>"}

Beyond general-purpose LLMs, there are AI tools designed specifically to support bibliographic and document research. They integrate querying, classification, and synthesis functions aimed at optimizing literature review phases.

#### [![Elicit](images/elicit.png){width="16%"}](https://elicit.com/)

Elicit is a tool specifically developed to **support bibliographic and document research activities** by leveraging LLMs applied to structured academic corpora.\
Unlike traditional search engines, Elicit is <u>capable of automatically extracting structured information from scientific articles, such as research questions, methods, key results, and citations</u>.

Its core functions include:\
- *Automatic identification and extraction of research-relevant elements from articles (e.g., title, authors, research questions, methods, results, citations)*.\
- *Synthesis of responses through thematic clustering and semantic categorization, facilitating the formulation of research hypotheses already informed by the state of the art*.\
- *Export of structured data in CSV or JSON formats, allowing integration with qualitative analysis software or reference management systems*.

For example, using Elicit, researchers can generate summary tables containing:\
- *Main articles identified based on a query*\
- *Automatically synthesized abstracts*\
- *Extracted research questions and primary findings*\
- *Structured citation metadata*.

These features make Elicit particularly suitable for <u>preparing systematic reviews and meta-analyses</u>, offering researchers not only a <u>list of sources</u> but also <u>structured overviews</u> that can directly inform project design, grant proposal drafting, and academic writing processes.

Compared to generic LLMs, Elicit provides:\
- **Focused output**: responses are oriented towards factual and structured information rather than general linguistic generation.\
- **Source verification**: results are derived from curated academic databases, enhancing the reliability and validity of the information obtained.\
- **Workflow integration**: data produced by Elicit can be incorporated into existing academic workflows, including qualitative analysis platforms and reference management systems.

However, it is important to note that Elicit does not replace the critical evaluation of sources by the researcher. While the tool offers substantial support in reducing the time needed for literature search and data extraction, <u>**each piece of information should be validated**</u> according to the standards of academic rigor and methodology.

#### [![Scite](images/scite.png){width="14%"}](https://scite.ai/)

Scite is a specialized platform designed to **support bibliometric analysis and literature evaluation** by focusing on the citation context of academic publications.\
Unlike traditional bibliographic databases, which report citation counts without specifying their nature, Scite <u>enables researchers to assess not only the number but also the type and content of citations received by a given article</u>.

Its principal functionalities include:\
- *Analysis of citation context, distinguishing between supportive citations, contrasting citations, and neutral mentions*.\
- *Integration with academic databases to provide comprehensive and structured citation data across multiple disciplines*.\
- *Visualization of citation patterns through interactive dashboards, facilitating both individual article assessment and broader literature mapping*.

For each publication, Scite provides:\
- *The total number of citations, classified into supportive, contrasting, and mentioning categories*.\
- *Detailed reports including the text surrounding each citation, allowing for qualitative evaluation of the citing sources*.\
- *Metrics that can complement traditional bibliometric indicators, offering a more nuanced understanding of a publication’s impact*.

These features make Scite particularly valuable in phases such as:\

- **Research assessment and evaluation processes**, where citation context can inform more sophisticated performance metrics.\
- **Grant proposal preparation and institutional reporting**, where evidence of scholarly impact requires qualitative as well as quantitative support.

While Scite enhances citation analysis capabilities, **it does not substitute for in-depth content analysis by domain experts**. <u>The interpretation of citation types and their implications remains the responsibility of the researcher</u>. Additionally, coverage may vary depending on discipline and database integration, making it advisable to verify source completeness and relevance in each specific research context.

## 4. Plugins and APIs for SSH and STEM: when and why to use them

In Academic research contexts — whether in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) or STEM discipline — the use of plugins and **APIs associated with GAI models plays a crucial role** whenever functional integration with existing information systems or automation of recurring tasks is required.\
Unlike general-purpose tools, [**APIs (Application Programming Interface)**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/api) allow direct incorporation of language model capabilities or specialized platforms into workflows already established within institutional or corporate environments</u>.

Typical applications include:\
- <u>Automated classification and organization of textual data</u>, achieved by integrating language models within document management systems or digital archives, allowing for more efficient handling and retrieval of large volumes of unstructured information.\
- <u>Automated generation of metadata and descriptors for datasets</u>, which facilitates the management and curation of research archives, bibliographic repositories, or complex digital collections by systematically assigning structured information to each resource.\
- <u>Controlled multilingual content translation</u>, through the use of AI integrated into editorial platforms or academic repositories. This approach enables not only the automatic translation of content but also the application of customized dictionaries or specialized glossaries to ensure terminological consistency and accuracy across different languages.\
- <u>Semantic querying of complex databases</u>, allowing researchers to submit natural language queries that surpass the limitations of traditional keyword-based search systems, thereby improving the precision and relevance of retrieved results.

In **STEM fields**, plugins are commonly adopted to extend functionalities such as:\
- *Statistical analysis*\
- *Symbolic computation*\
- *Code generation*\
- *Data visualization*.

In **SSH contexts**, plugins are particularly useful for:\
- *Extending bibliographic database and historical archive querying capabilities*\
- *Integrating text mining and sentiment analysis tools*\
- *Automating the production of reports or summaries from complex linguistic corpora*.

::: {.callout-tip title="<span style='font-size:1.1em; color: #133869ff;'>Important Considerations</span>"}
The adoption of plugins and APIs involves **specific evaluations concerning security, sensitive data management, and regulatory compliance, especially within the European academic context where regulations such as GDPR apply**.\
You can choose between plugins and APIs depending on your project’s nature.\
Plugins are easier to use because they come ready-made and already integrated. APIs, on the other hand, let you customize things more, but they require <u>more technical skills</u> to set up and manage.
